You have been engaged as a Data Science consultant by a coal terminal. They would like you to investigae one of their heavy machine - RL1

You have been supplied one month worth of data for all their machines. The dataset shows what percentage of capacity for each machine was idle (unused) in any given hour.
You are required to deliver an R list with the following components


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
